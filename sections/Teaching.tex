            We therefore argue that the concept of the \lq\lq non-computationally literate'' biologist must be abandoned. There is evidence that biologists are aware of their shortcomings when it comes to data analysis in general, but this realisation often occurs post-data acquisition \citep{Attwood2017}. Over the last twelve months, we have been attempting to address this challenge with a series of short workshops, introducing biologists to basic concepts in image analysis. The principal aims of these workshops are:\par

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{In the short term, to encourage researchers to think about analysis prior to acquiring images.}
\item \textbf{Longer term, to establish a network of image analysts at The Crick}, whereby each lab in the institute has a staff member comfortable with at least basic image analysis tasks. It is therefore important that the introductory workshop encourages participants to learn more.
