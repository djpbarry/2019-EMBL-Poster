			\tfont
			We have begun using GIANI to quantitatively analyse mouse embryos in 3D. This analysis has begun to reveal differences in morphology and protein expression between different experimental conditions. Analysis of synthetic ground truth data is being used to confirm the validity of these results. Further development of GIANI is planned, with the specific aim of improving segmentations in noisy and dense fields of view. Extension to timelapse analysis is also being considered. GIANI is freely available on GitHub (github.com/djpbarry/Giani).
