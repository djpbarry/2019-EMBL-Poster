\block{\begin{blockbody}\section{Summary}
			\tfont
            The need for quantitative data analysis skills in life science research is well-established, driven by the large volumes of data being generated by modern imaging technologies. However, most biologists lack such skills. We have been attempting to address this skills gap over the last twelve months with image analysis training workshops targeted at uninitiated researchers. The results thus far have been highly encouraging, with the vast majority of course attendees reporting positively about the course content and expressing a desire to learn more. Of particular encouragement is the willingness of researchers to learn scripting, a necessary skill in order to fully harness the capabilities of automated image analysis methodologies. This bodes well for our stated aim of establishing a network of image analysts at The Crick.\par
