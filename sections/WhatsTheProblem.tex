			There is a lack of open-software software suitable for analysing large quantities of 3D microscopy data derived from cell biology experiments. We seek a solution that (a) natively handles 3D data, (b) runs an automated analysis pipeline, (c) prioritises data production over visualisation, (d) is fast and (e) can optionally be run on a cluster.
