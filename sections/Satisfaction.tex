            After each installment of the workshop, participants are asked to complete a brief survey. The following three bar charts show participants overall satisfaction with the workshop (left), the level of difficulty they assigned to the challenges in the workshop (centre) and their interest in participating in further workshops (right).\par\vms

            Participants were also asked whether they felt their understanding of image analysis was improved by the workshop (below left) and whether they would feel comfortable teaching their colleagues what they learned (below right).\par\vms

            The fact that most participants rated the workshop highly is obviously encouraging, but even more encouraging is the fact that so many are interested in further training and passing on their training to colleagues.\par
